\section pool Pool
The class \ref dynamicgraph::PoolStorage keeps track of the entities
instanciated with the factory. The entities are the graph nodes. Signals are
constructed during the class instanciation, they do not live independently from
the entities. Signals are the directed edges of the graph. The pool can write a
file representing the graph of entities.
