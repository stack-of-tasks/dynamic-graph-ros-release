///
/// \brief Provides a way to create Entity objects from their class
/// name.
///
/// The dynamic graph frameworks relies on entities (see Entity)
/// which defines atomic processing units. This class provides a
/// robust way to enumerate and instantiate these entities.
/// Each entity has a name (its type name) and can be instantiated.
/// Each instance also has a name.
///
/// For instance one can define a C++ class called MyEntity which
/// inherits from dynamicgraph::Entity. This type can be registered
/// into the factory to teach the framework that:
/// - this entity exists
/// - this entity can be instantiated (and how to instantiate it).
///
/// To achieve this, one must pass an entity name and a function pointer.
///
/// The entity name will identify the class <b>at run-time</b>
/// (be careful: this may not be equivalent to the C++ class name
/// even if it is recommended to do so).
///
/// The function pointer must point on a function taking a string as
/// input and returning an instance of the Entity (the concrete
/// subclass, not directly the upper Entity class).
///
/// The instances returned by this function <b>must</b> be
/// dynamically allocated and the caller <b>must</b> get the
/// ownership of the instance (i.e. it will free it when required).
///
/// To finish, please note that the instance name indicates to the
/// entity how the instance itself is called at run-time.  This name
/// does not need to be unique and no check is done on it.  It is
/// the caller responsibility to make sure that the instance name is
/// appropriate and to check for uniqueness if required.
///
///
/// This class is a singleton. The rationale is that each
/// unique name must identify a unique Entity. The use of a single
/// instance of this class enforces this behavior, instantiating one
/// yourself would break this property.
